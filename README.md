## Tech Sack Used
- `Vite`: React frontend framework
- `Django`: A high level python web framework tht encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design
- `Redis`:An in memory database, a memory cache, that can persist data on a disk, allowing fast data access and storage
- `Daphne`: Is a HTTP, HTTP2 and websocketts protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP, developed to power Django channels

- `Tailwind css`: Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. Unlike other frameworks, like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.
- `Reduxjs`: Redux is a predictable state container for javascript applications. Used for managing the state of the application, such as user interaactions, cat=rt functionalities and API responses
